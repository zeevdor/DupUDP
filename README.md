# DupUDP
simple python script for duplicating UDP traffic 

i used it for duplicating predeterminated (destination IP address) unicast video stream into:
  1. localy
  2. second destination
the destination port needs to be switched for the local generated traffic - otherwise it will be capture by the script generating a loop.
there is no need to change it on the second destination.
(i keeped the same port number for both destinations to keep ot simple)

more destination lines can be added
